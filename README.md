# Could not successfully make a FlashCard App using Java and Scala
This app is a FlashCard App which I shall use for my own learning purposes  
because a flashcard is a great memory reinforcement tool.
I used Scala because I wanted to learn how to seamlessly integrate Java and Scala.
The primary purpose of this project was to learn about the Java and Scala integration  
which was acheived but due to Java discontinuing JavaFX  
and version mismanagement this project could not be completed.
